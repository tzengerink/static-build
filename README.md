STATIC-BUILD
------------
Easily concatinate and minify your JavaScript files and CSS stylesheets.

Simply edit `builds.json` to meet your needs. You should use the following
as your template:

    [{
        "dir" : "static",
        "css" : {
            "in" : [],
            "out" : "css/style.min.css"
        },
        "js" : {
            "in" : [],
            "out" : "js/script.min.js"
        }
    }]
